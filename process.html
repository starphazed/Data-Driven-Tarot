    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <div class="Concept">
        <h2>Concept and Development</h2>
        <h3>Merging Data and Tarot</h3>
        <p>The Data-Driven Tarot began as an exploration of how modern digital identities, often fractured and scattered
            across platforms, can be visually and symbolically unified. The idea emerged from my growing awareness of
            how
            much personal data I generate in my everyday life and how it shapes, distorts, and reflects aspects of
            myself—much like tarot cards reveal aspects of identity, personality, and destiny.

            At the core of this project was the desire to bridge the mystical with the digital, blending the ancient
            symbolic world of tarot with the hyper-modern, data-driven age we live in. Tarot has long been a tool for
            self-reflection, introspection, and navigating the unknown. Similarly, the data collected about us online is
            another form of reflection, a mirror of our habits, choices, and subconscious behaviors. However, unlike
            tarot,
            data presents a somewhat distorted, fragmented, and algorithmically-driven version of ourselves. I wanted to
            see
            how these two systems—one symbolic and spiritual, the other technical and data-driven—could interact to
            provide
            a deeper understanding of the self.</p>
        <h3>Why Tarot?</h3>
        <p>Choosing tarot as the framework for this project wasn’t arbitrary—it speaks to the way I wanted to represent
            both the seen and unseen aspects of identity. Tarot, with its rich history of symbols, spreads, and
            interpretations, mirrors how data is often seen as a way to gain insight into who we are. But just as a
            tarot card reading depends on interpretation, so does the understanding of data.

            Tarot operates on layers of symbolism and metaphor, while data is typically seen as objective and factual.
            The overlap is in the interpretation: in both tarot and data, meaning is found in how the pieces come
            together to tell a story. I aimed to combine these two methods of introspection by creating cards that not
            only represent personal traits or moments but also highlight how data algorithms and AI systems attempt to
            define or predict our identities. The cards serve as a visual and conceptual bridge between the mysticism of
            tarot and the seemingly concrete nature of data.</p>

    <div class="Research">
        <h2>Research and Ideation</h2>
        <h3>Initial Research</h3>
        <p>Initial Research: My first step was to delve into the history, structure, and visual traditions of tarot
            cards. Tarot has long been used as a tool for introspection and self-discovery, so I researched different
            decks, paying close attention to the use of symbols, archetypes, and card spreads.
            I analyzed popular tarot decks like the Rider-Waite Tarot and more contemporary decks that experiment with
            symbolism. Understanding how upright and reversed meanings offer dual interpretations became an important
            aspect of how I planned to represent both the positive and shadow aspects of personal data. I would also
            like to take the time to mention my <a link href="https://vonnart.net/tarot"> FAVOURITE DECK</a> of all time,
            which I discovered around 4 years ago and has been living rent free in my mind ever since.

            While tarot became the symbolic framework, I also needed to understand the nature of personal data and how
            it is collected, processed, and interpreted. I focused on the types of data that companies track—music
            listening habits, social media engagement, purchase histories, and browsing behaviors. This led me to
            explore how algorithms create profiles based on this data.

            I reviewed information about first-party and second-party data—the data collected directly from users, such
            as listening
            habits, device preferences, and social media interactions. I wanted to see how platforms like Spotify,
            Google, and social media platforms categorize users into different audiences. This inspired me to look at my
            own data and analyze which patterns emerged, such as my music preferences or the platforms I use to
            communicate.

            For the visual design, I researched various artistic movements, eventually settling on Art Nouveau as the
            primary aesthetic for the cards. This style is known for its elegant, organic lines and complex, decorative
            patterns. I felt that Art Nouveau’s flowing, harmonious design language would contrast beautifully with the
            idea of cold, digital data, reflecting the tension between the natural and the artificial.

            As part of the ideation process, I explored how I could integrate QR codes into the design without
            disrupting the visual flow of the cards. My goal was to create a seamless connection between the physical
            card and the digital data it represents. This required research into how QR codes function in terms of
            scanability and how I could weave them into the artwork without sacrificing the intricate details of the
            design.
        </p>
        <h3>Giving my Cards Meaning</h3>
        <p> then moved on to ideate each card based on my personal data. I started by listing the different types of
            data I regularly produce and interact with—such as music playlists, social media use, and technology habits.
            I mapped this data to tarot-like archetypes, considering which data streams best represented certain aspects
            of myself.
            For each card, I considered its upright and reversed meanings, reflecting the positive and shadow sides of
            my data behaviors. For example, The Chameleon represents my adaptability across platforms, while its
            reversed meaning suggests the potential loss of identity by constantly shifting between different personas.
        </p>
        <h3>User Interactivity</h3>
        <p>As the cards are meant to engage the audience beyond their physical form, I researched how viewers could
            interact with the tarot deck via QR codes. By scanning the codes, users could access deeper layers of
            interpretation and meaning creating an immersive experience where viewers are not just passive observers but
            active participants in uncovering the digital narrative behind each card. </p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>One of the key challenges during ideation was balancing the symbolic and aesthetic elements with the
            functional aspects of data visualization. I needed the cards to be visually appealing, true to the tarot
            tradition, and also representative of real data patterns.
            I spent a significant amount of time thinking about how to make the QR codes an integral part of the design,
            rather than something that detracts from it. The solution was to weave the codes into the Art Nouveau
            aesthetic, ensuring they fit seamlessly into the visual language of the cards.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Prototyping and Testing</h2>
    <p>The prototyping and testing phase was essential in bringing the conceptual ideas of my Data-Driven Tarot into a
        tangible form. Since this project required a delicate balance between aesthetics, symbolism, and digital
        functionality, creating iterative prototypes allowed me to refine both the visual and interactive elements,
        ensuring that the cards resonated with the intended message while maintaining technical integrity.

        My first stage of prototyping involved transforming the QR codes into different patterns and designs using
        Stable Diffusion and a model called QR Code Monster that I set up to run on my desktop. I realise now that maybe
        I should have saved some of my initial tests to add as a part of my reflection. My main struggle was in this
        part of my project, trying to find the right balance between imagery and the QR code but I eventually decided to
        do a more Art Nouveau floral pattern for the codes instead to ensure that the cards would remain scannable while
        also not looking out of place.

        Once I was satisfied with the result of my QR codes and confident that Tarot Card deck would be functional, things started looking up and I
        set up a website on Github pages to allow me to create pages for each card. I then generated QR codes using the
        link and ran them through Stable Diffusion to achieve the pattern that I wanted.

        On Adobe Illustrator, I began to design the back of the cards, using traditional and mystical symbolism of Tarot
        merged with futuristic elements of data and technology. I settled on a minimalistic color palette to contrast
        the details of the intricate QR codes, so it wouldn't result in something too visually overwhelming. Some of the
        assets used were hand-drawn but most were from Adobe Stock Images due to time constraints.</p>

        <img src="cardbackproto.jpg" alt="Prototyping">

        <p>Once the back of the cards were designed, I began to design each card, 12 in total, using the same mystical
        elements of tarot, also numbering them like a traditional deck. Once I was happy with the base template for each
        card, I imported their respective generated QR code patterns, converted them to a 2 color image and expanded
        them into editable layers from images so I could alter the colors to fit my color palette. Once I was
        satisfied with them, I lastly added each card's illustration to the respective cards.

        I then printed out the cards and their backs seperately on my printer at home, using 300gsm cardstock. As
        carefully as I could, I cut each card and it's back out, maybe getting a little imaptient in the process and
        resulting in a few wonky edges, and then glued the back and front of the cards. I tested all the cards to make
        sure they were scannable and didn't have any mistakes and while doing so, I had the idea to make a box for them
        as well.

        I am certifiably terrible at origami and had no idea how to make the box. I pulled up illustrator again, making
        sure to make the sides of the box slightly bigger and tried to unfold the shape of the box in my head, adding
        tabs to the sides that would need to be glued together. I decorated the box and also added a QR code to the back
        that would take users to the general website for the cards so they could read all of them, along with this
        reflection page as well. Surprisingly, the box was a success on the first try.

        Finally, I added text to each card's page and did some basic styling in CSS to ensure it was readable on the
        user's phone.

    <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
    <p> I'm actually really surprised how well my project went and how professional It looks. I was afraid of it looking
        like a DIY hackjob or an arts and crafts project but I think that my concept is strong and my design choices
        were perfect for this prototype and definitely look like a commerical project. The responses to it have also
        been positive, many finding it fascinating to be able to interact with the deck through QR codes while also
        mainting the physical process of shuffling and selecting a card.</p>

    <h2>Further Developments and References</h2>
    <h3>The Future of Data Tarot</h3>
    <p>For the future of this project, I would like to dive deeper into my own data and design more cards to have a
        larger deck. I also know that the website in its current state is extremely basic and needs more visual content
        to be more engaging. I also need to make sure the media on the website is responsive to different devices and
        screens as currently it is only ensured to be readable on a mobile device.

        For the far future, one of the most exciting possibilities for future development is the creation of
        user-specific tarot decks. Rather than the cards being based solely on my data, I could design a system that
        allows individuals to input their own data (e.g., Spotify listening habits, social media usage, purchasing
        patterns) to generate personalized tarot cards that reflect their unique digital behaviors. I could develop a
        system where communities or groups can collaborate on building a collective tarot deck based on shared data or
        themes. For example, a group of friends, coworkers, or a specific social media community could input their
        collective data to generate cards that reflect their shared experiences.

        Another possibility is deepening the connection between the physical and digital realms by exploring the
        integration of augmented reality into the cards. By scanning the QR codes with an AR-enabled device,
        users could view animated elements of the cards, bringing the tarot symbolism to life in a dynamic, interactive
        way.</p>
