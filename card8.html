    <h1>The Avatar</h1>
    <p>In digital spaces, I create different versions of myself. Whether through profiles, avatars, or the curated parts
        of my personality that I choose to show, The Avatar represents the self I create online. It’s a reflection of
        how my data builds an image of me, one that’s not always the full picture but is still a version of who I am.

        <h2>Upright Meaning</h2>
        <p>Creation: You have the power to shape and create your own identity, both online and in the real world. You
            can be whoever you choose to be, and you are in control of your self-image.
            Duality: You are balancing multiple aspects of your life or identity. You have mastered the art of living in
            different worlds (digital, personal, professional).
            Agency: You have a strong sense of agency over your life. You are creating the reality you want to live in.
        </p>

    <div class="down">
        <h2>Reversed Meaning</h2>
        <p>Fragmentation: Your identity is fractured, with too many personas pulling you in different directions. You
            may feel like you’re losing a sense of who you really are.
            Disconnection: You may be overly invested in your virtual self or online identity, causing a disconnection
            from your real-world relationships or personal authenticity.
            Illusion: Be careful not to create an illusion or false identity that doesn’t align with your true self.
            There is a risk of losing touch with reality.</p>
