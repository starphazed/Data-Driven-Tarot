    <h1>The Wayfarer</h1>
    <p class="intro">I’ve always been someone who enjoys the act of exploration, not just of the world around me but of ideas,
        perspectives, and experiences. The Wayfarer captures that sense of movement and discovery. My data reflects the
        many places—both literal and metaphorical—that I travel to, constantly seeking new experiences and knowledge.

        <h2>Upright Meaning</h2>
        <p class="meaning">Transition: You are in a period of movement, whether it’s physical travel or a transition in life. Trust the
            journey and know that you are being guided toward your next destination.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Exploration: You are eager to explore new horizons, and this is the perfect time to step outside of your
            comfort zone and embrace new experiences.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Freedom: Movement brings freedom, and you are not tied down to any one place or path. You have the power to
            choose your direction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="down">
        <h2>Reversed Meaning</h2>
        <p class="meaning">Restlessness: You are craving change, but it feels elusive. There’s a sense of dissatisfaction with your
            current state, and you may feel stuck or directionless.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Resistance: You are resisting a necessary transition. Fear of the unknown is holding you back from fully
            embracing change.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Wandering: You may be moving without purpose, searching for something but not sure what it is. It’s time to
            pause and reflect on what you truly seek.</p>
