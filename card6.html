    <h1>The Faceless One</h1>
    <p class="intro">Sometimes I feel like my online presence is fragmented, with different parts of me showing up in different
        places. The Faceless One reflects this sense of anonymity or the idea that, in many ways, my true identity is
        hidden behind layers of data, usernames, and profiles. It captures the ambiguity of who I am in the digital
        space, where I’m both seen and unseen.</p>

        <h2>Upright Meaning</h2>
        <p class="meaning">Anonymity: There is power in remaining unseen or in the background. Sometimes, working behind the scenes
            allows you to influence things without drawing too much attention.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Freedom: You are free from labels or expectations. By not fitting into a single role or identity, you are
            free to explore different parts of yourself.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Mystery: Others are drawn to the mystery around you. The less you reveal, the more intrigue you create,
            allowing you to maintain control over how you are perceived.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="down">
        <h2>Reversed Meaning</h2>
        <p class="meaning">Loss of Identity: You may feel lost or disconnected from your true self. Hiding behind too many personas or
            identities has led to a sense of confusion about who you really are.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Invisibility: You feel overlooked or undervalued because your true identity isn’t being acknowledged. It's
            time to reclaim your voice and assert who you really are.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Conformity: There is a risk of being absorbed into the crowd or losing your individuality to fit in. Don’t
            let external expectations dictate who you are.</p>
