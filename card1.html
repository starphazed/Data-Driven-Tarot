    <p class="intro">Music is such an important part of my life, both online and offline. The songs I listen to and the playlists I
        create tell a story about my emotions, moods, and experiences. The Melodist represents the way I use music to
        express myself and how it harmonizes with different parts of who I am. My data around music—what I listen to,
        when, and how—feels like a direct reflection of my emotional landscape.</p>
