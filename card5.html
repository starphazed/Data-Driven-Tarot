    <h1>The Empress of Echoes</h1>
    <p class="intro">I’m aware of how my actions and choices create ripples, especially in digital spaces. Every post, search, or
        click leaves a trace, and those echoes continue long after the moment has passed. The Empress of Echoes
        represents the lasting impact of my digital footprint. It’s about the influence I have—whether I see it or
        not—and how my data carries a piece of me into the world.</p>

        <h2>Upright Meaning</h2>
        <p class="meaning">Influence: Your actions have a lasting impact, and what you create or say will continue to resonate long
            after you've moved on. You are in a position of influence, and your voice carries weight.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Reflection: Be mindful of the energy you put into the world, as it will come back to you. This is a time of
            reflecting on how your past actions are still influencing your present.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Legacy: What you are building now will echo through time, creating a legacy. You are planting seeds that

        <h2>Reversed Meaning</h2>
        <p class="meaning">Distortion: Your influence may be misunderstood or misused. Be careful that your actions or words are not
            distorted as they echo through time or others' interpretations.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Unseen Impact: You may not realize the weight your words or actions carry, leading to unintended
            consequences.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Echo Chamber: Beware of surrounding yourself with only like-minded individuals, leading to an echo chamber
            where new ideas are stifled.</p>
