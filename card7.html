    <h1>The Journeyer</h1>
    <p class="intro">Life is a journey, and I’m always learning and evolving. The Journeyer reflects my personal growth and
        exploration, both internally and externally. The data that I accumulate through my online activity shows the
        steps I’m taking in my own journey of self-discovery—whether through learning new things, trying different
        experiences, or just reflecting on the path I’m on.</p>

    <div class="up">
        <h2>Upright Meaning</h2>
        <p class="meaning">Self-Discovery: You are on a journey of personal growth, and each step is bringing you closer to your true
            self. Every experience is a lesson.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Progression: You are moving forward, even if the path is unclear. Trust that your steps are leading you
            toward your purpose.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Exploration: This is a time for adventure and exploration. Seek out new experiences that broaden your
            perspective and understanding of the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="down">
        <h2>Reversed Meaning</h2>
        <p class="meaning">Stagnation: You feel stuck in one place, unable to move forward on your journey. There may be fear or
            uncertainty about the path ahead.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Wandering: You are moving without direction or purpose, which is leading to frustration or confusion. It’s
            time to refocus and find your path.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Avoidance: Instead of facing challenges, you are avoiding them by constantly seeking the next distraction or
            adventure. It’s time to confront what you’ve been running from.</p>
