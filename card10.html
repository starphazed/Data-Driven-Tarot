    <h1>The Resonance</h1>
    <p class="intro">Everything I do has an impact, even if it’s not always obvious. The Resonance symbolizes the vibrations and
        energy I put out into the world, both in real life and through my digital actions. My data is a record of these
        echoes, showing how what I do ripples outward, touching others in ways I may not immediately see.</p>

    <div class="up">
        <h2>Upright Meaning</h2>
        <p class="meaning">Vibration: Everything you do sends out ripples. You are in a state of alignment, and your energy is
            resonating deeply with those around you.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Connection: There is a deep emotional or spiritual connection at play. You are in tune with the world around
            you, and the vibrations you send out are positive and uplifting.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Legacy: Your actions now will have a lasting impact. What you put out into the world will continue to
            resonate long after you’re gone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="down">
        <h2>Reversed Meaning</h2>
        <p class="meaning">Disharmony: There is a disconnect between your intentions and the results. You may be out of sync with those
            around you or with your environment.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Distortion: Your message or actions are being misinterpreted, causing confusion or misunderstandings.</p>
        <p class="meaning">Invisibility: You may feel like your voice or efforts are going unnoticed. Despite your efforts, you’re not
            seeing the resonance you hoped for.</p>
