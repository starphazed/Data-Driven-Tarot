    <h1>The Resonance</h1>
    <p>Everything I do has an impact, even if it’s not always obvious. The Resonance symbolizes the vibrations and
        energy I put out into the world, both in real life and through my digital actions. My data is a record of these
        echoes, showing how what I do ripples outward, touching others in ways I may not immediately see.</p>

        <h2>Upright Meaning</h2>
        <p>Vibration: Everything you do sends out ripples. You are in a state of alignment, and your energy is
            resonating deeply with those around you.
            Connection: There is a deep emotional or spiritual connection at play. You are in tune with the world around
            you, and the vibrations you send out are positive and uplifting.
            Legacy: Your actions now will have a lasting impact. What you put out into the world will continue to
            resonate long after you’re gone.</p>
