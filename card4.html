    <h1>The Chameleon</h1>
    <p class="intro">I’ve always been adaptable, able to shift and change depending on the situation. In my digital life, this is even
        more evident. The way I present myself on different platforms, the roles I take on in different communities—The
        Chameleon represents how I blend in or stand out depending on what’s needed. My data reflects this flexibility
        and adaptability, showing how I can be many different things at once.</p>

            authenticity.</p>
