    <h1>The Cyber Magus</h1>
    <p class="intro">Technology is woven into everything I do. I’m constantly surrounded by it, whether through coding, digital tools,
        or just my general tech-savvy lifestyle. The Cyber Magus represents how I harness technology to shape my
        identity and create my world. It’s about mastering digital spaces and making them work for me, just as I
        navigate and control the data that comes from my online presence.</p>
