    <h1>The Web Weaver</h1>
    <p>My connections—both online and in real life—are integral to who I am. The Web Weaver reflects how I build
        networks, whether through social media, professional spaces, or friendships. It represents how my relationships
        are interconnected and how my data is shaped by the people I interact with. Everything I do online is part of a
        bigger web of interactions, and this card captures that.</p>
