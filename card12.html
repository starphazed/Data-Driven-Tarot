    <h1>The Shadow</h1>
    <p>There are parts of me that remain hidden, even in the digital world. The Shadow reflects those aspects of myself
        that I don’t always confront, but that exist nonetheless. My data may reveal patterns or habits that reflect
        this shadow side, and this card acknowledges the complexity of identity, including the parts that stay in the
        dark.</p>
    <div class="up">
        <h2>Upright Meaning</h2>
        <p>Subconscious: You are exploring the hidden parts of yourself. This is a time for delving into your shadow
            self, uncovering what has been hidden or repressed.
            Reflection: The shadow represents the parts of yourself that are hard to face but necessary for growth.
            Embrace these aspects, as they will bring greater self-awareness.
            Mystery: There is something unseen at play in your life. Trust that what is hidden will soon come to light,
            and be open to the mystery of the unknown.</p>

    <div class="down">
        <h2>Reversed Meaning</h2>
        <p>Repression: You are avoiding confronting your shadow self, and this is leading to inner conflict. It’s time
            to face the parts of yourself that you’ve been hiding.
            Fear: You are afraid of what lies beneath the surface. There may be a fear of the unknown or fear of facing
            your inner truths.
            Denial: You are refusing to acknowledge something important. This avoidance is preventing you from fully
            understanding yourself or the situation.
